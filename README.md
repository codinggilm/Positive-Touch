# Positive Touch
 

## Description
This site is built for the company Positive Touch Ltd, specialised in dog training and canine science.<br />

I designed and coded everything, based on what the client requires and my own ideas. I do not use any component library (Material UI etc) or any kind of code copied from another source except Scroll Reveal and SwiperJS - used to allow picture gallery to be swiped on mobile displays<br />

It is still a work in progress, but most of the content is present and the site is now responsive on various displays.<br />

This is a SPA built using React and SASS, and once the front end is fully produced, the backend will be built using Node.js and PostgreSQL.<br />


 
## Improving the site and the code
Current workload:<br />
- Fix home page main picture behaviour on mobile
- Fix footer display on mobile
- Implement large tablet display
- Fine tune mobile responsiveness 
- Customise the Swipe feature
- Remove unused components and scss files from the folders 
- Clean up unused imports.
- Create an import file for pictures
- Remove commented code (previous ideas or attempts)
