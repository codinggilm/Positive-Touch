# Positive Touch
 

## Description
This site is built for the company Positive Touch Ltd, specialised in dog training and canine science.<br />

I designed and coded everything, based on what the client requires. I do not use any component library (Material UI etc) or any kind of code copied from another source.<br />

It is still a work in progress, but most of the content is present and the site is responsive on various displays.<br />

This is a SPA built using React and SASS, and once the front end is fully produced, the backend will be built using Node.js and PostgreSQL.<br />


 
## Improving the site and the code
Current workload:<br />
- Implementing large tablet display; the site is responsive for mobiles and standard tablets, but the display for larger tablets needs some adjustments<br />
- Implementing picture swipe ability on mobile display (on "Meet Ellie" page)  <br />
- Removing unused components from the folders - some components previously made but not in use need to be removed. 
- Cleaning up unused imports. <br />
- Creating an import file for pictures. <br />
