# Positive Touch
 

## Description
This site is built for the company Positive Touch Ltd, specialised in dog training and canine science.<br />

I designed and coded everything, based on what the client requires. I do not use any component library (Material UI etc) or any kind of code copied from another source.<br />

It is still a work in progress, but most of the content is present.<br />

This site is a SPA built using React and SASS, and once the front end is fully produced, the backend will be built using Node.js and PostgreSQL.<br />


 
## Improving the site and the code
Current workload:<br />
- Implementing large tablet display; at the moment, only standard tablet viewing has been added. Larger tablets like iPad Pro require a few extra modifications.<br />
- Mobile viewing also needs work and some components require conditional rendering based on viewport width. Right now, only the home page is nearly done. <br />
- Cleaning up the unused SASS codes. Some of my previous ideas are still there, they need to be removed to improve file readability and keep the code clean. <br />
- Removing unused components from the folders. Like for the CSS / SASS code, some components previously made but not in use need to be removed. 
- Cleaning up unused imports. <br />
- Creating an import file for pictures. <br />
